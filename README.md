# Analysis-with-SQL

There are various tools that can used for analysis, once in a while one will only need high level overview ahead of engaging on other visualization tools, SQL provides a good platform to perform lots especially creating tables and manipulating them in one line of code.

The analysis undertaken with this project was to help with wrapping my head round some skillset that seemed to have been forgotten, they include

    * Altering tables
    * Adding columns on an existing table
    * Updating tables and setting values
    * Multiple filtering using the where clause
    * Joining tables
